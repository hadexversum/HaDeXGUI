## Differential Uptake curve 

This plot presents differential uptake curves for the selected peptide between two biological states. 

On the X axis there are time points of measurement (in minutes). The axis is in logaritmic scale for readability (this can be changed in the settings on the left panel). 

On th Y axis there are values of differential deuterium uptake, in selected form.
