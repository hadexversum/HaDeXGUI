## Manhattan Plot

Manhattan plot is a novel plot, presenting the P-value of statistical significance between two states for peptides, along the information of their length and position.

On the X axis there is peptide position in the protein sequence. On the Y axis there is negative logaritmic value of P-value between two states selected in the Settings panel on the left. The P-value is calculated using the t-Student test. The time points of measurement are distinquished with the colors, as specified on the legend below the plot.

### HaDeX tip

When the option `Show time points separately?` is checked in the Settings panel on the left, in the Visualization section, the plots for time point chosen are presented next to each other, instead of one plot.
