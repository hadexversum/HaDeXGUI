## FD time point

Files from HDeXaminer don\'t provide the numerical value of time point 
for the fully deuterated sample but flag it as "FD". For precise values 
on the plots and data, HaDeX needs a numerical value in minutes.
The value (1440 min = 24 h) is commonly used and is suggested, but 
the user can change it to its real value.
