## Chiclet Differential Plot

Chiclet differential plot shows the deuterium uptake difference between two biological states in the form of a heatmap. One tile indicates the peptide (identified by its ID - number arranged by the start position) in a time point of measurement. The color of the tile indicates the deuterium uptake difference (according to the legend below the plot).
