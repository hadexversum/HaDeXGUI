## Uncertainty plot

Uncertainty plot is new visualization method, showing the uncertainty of measurement of deuterium uptake for peptides to spot the regions where the uncertainty is higher. This plot may be used as a quality control of the experiment. The presented uncertainty is in Daltons, making the threshold 1 Da as proposed limit of acceptance.

On the X axis there is peptide position in the protein sequence. On the Y axis there is the calculated uncertainty of measured mass.  The time points of measurement are distinquished with the colors, as specified on the legend below the plot.


### HaDeX tip

When the option `Show time points separately?` is checked in the Settings panel on the left, in the Visualization section, the plots for time point chosen are presented next to each other, instead of one plot.
