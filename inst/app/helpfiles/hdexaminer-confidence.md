## Measurement confidence

Files from HDeXaminer have a `Confidence` column that tells how
reliable each measurement (and recognition of the peptide) is.
There are three levels of confidence: High, Medium, and Low.

The user can choose which results should be considered for processing. Following the authors of HDeXaminer, we recommend
to ignore low-confidence results.
