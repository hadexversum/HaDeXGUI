## Number of replicates per peptide

The histogram shows how many replicates were done for specific peptide during the experiment. The colors indicates the time point of measurement. 
The peptides are specified by their ID. 

`Data` tab and the tooltips provide additional information e.g. the position of the peptide in the protein sequence.
